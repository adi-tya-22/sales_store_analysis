Sales Store Analysis
Store Background
A retail store chain tracks daily sales transactions, including order details, customer information, product categories, order times, and order status. The business aims to optimize operations, improve customer experience, and increase profitability through data-driven decisions.

Problem Statement
The store currently lacks clarity on:

Which products are the top sellers
Customer preferences
Items that generate the most profit
Operational issues in delivery or other areas
This lack of insight leads to missed revenue opportunities, customer loss, and suboptimal business decisions.

Solution
To address these issues, the store needs comprehensive reports and clear insights to better understand sales dynamics, customer behaviors, and product performance. This will enable more informed decision-making and strategic planning.
